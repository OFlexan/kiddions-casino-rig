# Kiddions Modest Menu Casino Rig
This script only has one purpose, and that is to add back the "Rig Slot Machines" and "Lose Slot Machines" options to Modest Menu that were removed with the v1.0.1 update.

# How To Use
Download the file `BytadedCasinoRig.lua` and drop it into your Modest Menu installation under the `scripts` folder.  
If Kiddions was already running, press `Menu Settings` -> `Reload Scripts` inside the menu, else run Kiddions.  
To use it, navigate to `Scripts` -> `Online Services (Bytaded)` -> `Casino Services` inside the menu, and you will find the original options for rigging the slot machines.

# Caution
The script should not pose any more risk than the original options, but the usual warnings apply.  
From a Reddit mod: when used, others in your session can/may notice, also abusing it is considered risky

I am not responsible for any damage this script or your actions may cause. If the script does not seem to work correctly, immediately cease usage of the script.
